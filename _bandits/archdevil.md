## Abilities:

**Slam**

Upon landing, stuns all the surrounding enemies for 1.5s.

## How to use ##
ADs are perfect to bring to the battle with their ability to stun a big area,
use it as another stormspire stun or use them to keep the first wave off your bandits.

## Description:

Having high health & armor, massive damage and bonus armor penetration with same attack speed as Seraph, Archdevil is a perfect warrior.

Besides these stats, Archdevilâ€™s advantage is its ability to spawn freely in the map (except mountainous area). This unit will attack the nearest enemies and stunt surrounding units in 1.5s after being deployed. To utilize stun duration, we do not recommend dropping this unit consecutively. Stun area is quite large so consider bringing just enough Archdevil. Personally, I usually carry 1 or 2 of this unit for a symmetric battle.

The more units Archdevil can stun, the quicker it dies. Because all enemy damage will focus on Archdevil after its ability is triggered.

Overall, Archdevil is the pioneer, good for combat setting during the first waves. It is also an effective support, increasing viability for other friendly units if they get stunned.
